# TSP  

This project was implemented according to Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) and it asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?  
Inputs are: n cities, with their locations (x and y coordinates) in a 2D grid.  
Output is: Ordering (tour) of these cities so that total distance to travel is minimized.  
Distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidian distance rounded to the nearest integer.
